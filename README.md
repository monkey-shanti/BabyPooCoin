# BabyPoo
## A revolutionary idea

BabyPoo prides itself for being at the forefront of the shitcoin industry. Why? Our reward tokenomics are unlike any others. We do not offer rewards in unstable and bearish BTC or BNB, nor do we promise the stable and boring BUSD.

Every 60 minutes, we reward our holders with PooCoin Tokens! This twist on our reward feature allows for endless possibilities, the most important being: infinite upside for investors.


The PooCoin Token already has a massive following, a large market cap, and a substantial liquidity pool. It is the native currency of PooCoin, which is by far the most recognized website in the shitcoin industry. Not one shitcoin investor, new or old, hasn’t heard or used PooCoin at least once. Thanks to its popularity, the PooCoin website is also a money making machine, generating hundreds of thousands (yes, hundreds of thousands) of dollars of ad revenue every DAY! While overlooked as such, the PooCoin platform is one of the key players in the shitcoin industry, and is definitely here to stay. The implications for the PooCoin token are therefore infinite: it’s user base is growing at an exponential rate, and it’s utility will widen as well.

The PooCoin token is already used by many to unlock premium features on the PooCoin website. Similarly to Youtube and other social media platforms, paying to get rid of ads will become common practice as the ads take more and more screen space, and the PooCoin token will gain even more popularity. But these are only examples. Very few tokens already have a money making platform to back their projects, and we see infinite potential in the PooCoin token.

## Pookenomics
With our experience in the DeFi space, we understood that cool tokenomics and features come at a price: high tax. However, many beginner investors are scared off by higher tax numbers, not grasping the potential gains yielded by each taxed transaction. For BabyPoo, we tried finding the right balance.

### Total Tax: 15%

- LP: 5% of each transaction is sent to the liquidity pool, to create a floor price and guarantee liquidity for future transactions
- PooCoin Rewards: 5% of each transaction is automatically converted to PooCoin tokens, and distributed amongst holders every 60 minutes
- Marketing and Development: 5% of each transaction is sent to a Marketing wallet, to guarantee perennial funds for Marketing

## Our Team: Why us?

We want to create something everyone can be proud of. A project with a smooth looking long term chart, led by developers with good intentions and a team that wants to create sustainable growth for investors.


We believe this can only be achieved by being fully transparent. In that sense, we are not shying away from the fact that most tokens in the defi space are genuinely lacking “intrinsic value”, and we have adjusted our approach accordingly.


Moving forward, all we want is to create a fun environment and unite our community behind one goal: The Moon. Learning from our own experience, and previously successful projects, we believe there is no reason to shy away from the truth, and leverage it to our advantage.
